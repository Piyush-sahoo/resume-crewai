PROJECTS

Research Gap Analyzer with LLMs & Semantic Scholar  
GitHub: github.com/piyushsahoo/research-gap-analyzer  
- Built an end-to-end NLP pipeline leveraging OpenAI GPT-3 via LangChain and Semantic Scholar API to automate research gap analysis from scientific literature.  
- Designed and deployed RESTful APIs using Flask; performed data wrangling with pandas and NumPy.  
- Implemented prompt engineering and multi-agent orchestration (LangChain/introductory LangGraph) to extract, synthesize, and summarize key topics, reducing manual literature analysis time by 60%.  
- Containerized application with Docker; deployed to cloud-based hosting with observability metrics (Netdata), showcasing hands-on AI/ML and DevOps integration.

ChatterBot ML-powered Conversational Assistant  
GitHub: github.com/piyushsahoo/chatterbot-assistant  
- Developed a customizable chatbot using ChatterBot (Python), trained on domain-specific corpora for improved accuracy and use-case adaptability.  
- Integrated with FastAPI and React frontend; deployed on cloud server using Docker and CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions).  
- Logged conversation flows, measured NLU performance, and iterated models based on A/B testing and stakeholder feedback.

Apna Meetup Platform – Full-Stack MERN  
GitHub: github.com/piyushsahoo/apna-meetup  
- Led development of a MERN stack application to connect tech enthusiasts and organize hybrid meetups across Bangalore.  
- Implemented user authentication, event management, and real-time collaboration features; employed Express.js REST APIs and MongoDB Atlas.  
- Integrated analytics dashboard (Tableau/Power BI prototype) for organizer insights; system scaled to 500+ active users within 3 months.

ML Model Lifecycle Demo (Personal Project)  
GitHub: github.com/piyushsahoo/ml-lifecycle-demo  
- Demonstrated the end-to-end ML workflow: EDA, data cleaning, feature engineering, training (scikit-learn, TensorFlow), hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and API serving via FastAPI.  
- Deployed inference endpoint with Docker and Kubernetes (Minikube); implemented monitoring, automated retraining script, and production logging.

Sorting Algorithm Visualizer  
GitHub: github.com/piyushsahoo/sorting-visualizer  
- Created an interactive visualization tool using ReactJS and JavaScript to help students learn and compare sorting algorithms.
