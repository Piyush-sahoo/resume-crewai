Keyword Priority Levels
For each job category, the 50 keywords are split into:

    Top Priority (20 keywords): Programming languages (e.g., Python, Java) and frameworks/tools (e.g., React, AWS). These are the most critical skills and carry the highest weight in scoring.
    Medium Priority (15 keywords): Certifications (e.g., CISSP, AWS Certified Solutions Architect) and specialized skills. These have moderate importance.
    Low Priority (15 keywords): Soft skills (e.g., communication, problem-solving). These are less critical and carry the lowest weight.

ATS Scoring Mechanism
    The ATS agent calculates a score based on the number of matching keywords found in the resume, with weights assigned to prioritize top priority keywords:

        Top Priority Keywords: 3 points each
        Medium Priority Keywords: 2 points each
        Low Priority Keywords: 1 point each
    The total score is the sum of points from matching keywords. For example, a resume with 5 top priority keywords (5 × 3 = 15), 3 medium priority keywords (3 × 2 = 6), and 2 low priority keywords (2 × 1 = 2) would score 15 + 6 + 2 = 23 points. You can normalize this to a percentage (e.g., out of a max score of 100) if desired.

Feedback Mechanism
    The ATS agent provides feedback by listing any missing top priority keywords from the resume. This helps candidates focus on adding the most critical skills to improve their score.
