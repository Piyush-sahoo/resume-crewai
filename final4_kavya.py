You're provided with a GitHub profile summary and a list of repositories for a candidate targeting a role at **{company_name}**.  
You also have access to job requirements and company expectations (via context).  

Your job is to analyze the GitHub profile and provide a **comprehensive, structured markdown report** covering the candidate's most relevant repositories for this job.

---

### üìÇ 1. Repository Filtering
- Include only **public, non-forked, technically significant** repositories.
- Use the job description and company profile to determine relevance.
- Select the **top 10 repositories** if more exist.

---

### üìò 2. For Each Selected Repository (Markdown Format)

Use this exact structure for each repo:

#### üîπ Repo: [RepoName](RepoURL)

- **Role**: (e.g., Owner / Maintainer / Contributor)
- **Stack**: (Python, React, AWS, etc.)
- **Stars**: ‚≠ê X | **Forks**: üç¥ Y | **Last Updated**: üìÜ MM/YYYY

---

1. **Main Purpose & Features**  
   Describe what the project does and what problems it solves. Include key features or capabilities.

2. **Technical Stack & Implementation**  
   Explain how the project is built. Mention languages, tools, architecture (e.g., REST APIs, microservices), and devops elements (CI/CD, containerization).

3. **Significance & Real-World Application**  
   Explain who this project is for and how it's useful in real-world scenarios, especially in relation to roles like the one at **{company_name}**.

4. **Code Quality & Maintenance**  
   Comment on the documentation, code organization, update activity, test coverage, and community engagement (if applicable).

- **Key Resume Keywords**: `Python`, `Docker`, `Security Automation`, `CI/CD`, ...

---

### üßæ 3. Resume Highlights

At the end, summarize **6‚Äì8 bullet points** from across all repositories.  
These should be **achievement-based**, written for a resume:

**Example:**
- Developed [Tracecat](https://github.com/...) using Docker + Temporal to automate security workflows for incident response.
- Deployed project on AWS Fargate using Terraform; improved deployment time by 70%.
- Integrated RESTful APIs with scalable architecture and YAML-driven orchestration logic.

##  **Phase 1: Relevance Matching** - **MOST IMPORTANT**

- Identify **projects** and **work experiences** in the CV that align directly with the job description.
- Focus on **technical stack**, **tools**, **problem-solving**, **collaboration**, and **delivery**.
- **Score the best 10 projects** (or fewer if less than 10) based on:
  - **Relevance to the job description**
  - **Skill match** (e.g., Python, React, etc.)
  - **Tools/tech match** with company/role
  - **Detail**: Add more descriptive insights into each project, emphasizing relevant keywords for the role and company.

---

##  **Phase 2: Skill Mapping** - **IMPORTANT**

- Extract top skills from the CV that match the JD (languages, frameworks, methodologies).
- Point out **missing** or **underrepresented** skills relevant to the role.
- Flag any **buzzwords** or vague areas to improve.

---

##  **Phase 3: Resume Enhancement Output** - **HIGHLIGHTED SECTION**

1. For each matched project:
   - Write a **detailed summary** of what makes it relevant .
   - Focus on **key learnings**, **tools used**, and **skills demonstrated**.
   - Emphasize how it connects to the JD/Company, highlighting specific skills or tools (e.g., "aligns with Python/AI focus at {company_name}").

2. End with:
   ** Optimized Resume Highlights for This Role**:
   - **4‚Äì6 bullet points** (copy-paste ready) customized for this company & JD.

---

##  **Suggested Improvements** - **TO BE ADDRESSED**

- Add more **specific details** or measurable outcomes to **Project X**, such as the improvements it led to or challenges overcome.
- Include **cloud computing** experience more prominently, especially if relevant to the company's tech stack (e.g., AWS, Azure).
- If there are any gaps in tools or technologies listed, consider adding skills like Docker, Kubernetes, or CI/CD tools if you have experience with them.
- Ensure that the **README** or project documentation clearly explains your contributions, and if possible, update any projects with more recent work or relevant additions.
